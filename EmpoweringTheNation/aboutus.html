                    "Empowering the Nation," is a nonprofit organization founded in 2018 by Precious Radebe. Inspired by her desire to help people in her community, especially those like her parents and elderly relatives who lacked educational opportunities, Precious created this initiative to make a positive impact.

                    "Empowering the Nation" focuses on training Johannesburgâ€™s gardeners and housekeepers in new skills. Precious identified a community need and developed a platform to enhance employability, increase income, and support small enterprises.
